# Playing Futures 2026


The first Playing Futures conference invites proposals that focus on issues related, but not limited to, any of the following topics, from the perspective of climate and energy futures:

-	Representations of climate and energy futures in videogames and board games.
-	Representations of climate and energy futures in role-playing games and LARPs.
-	Game communities.
-	Playable simulations.
-	Play practices.
-	Game development methods.
-	Game design.
-	Game technology.
-	Game philosophy.
-	Play theory.
-	Material practices in the game industry.
-	Game industry policies and regulations.

Playing Futures welcomes submissions in both traditional academic abstracts and interactive works. Traditional academic abstracts will undergo peer review for conference acceptance. We encourage the submission of late breaking work, works in progress, as well as more established research projects.

Interactive works include any digital or analog creations that can be shared through a platform like itch.io. The works must be playable, though not necessarily finished, and the conference must have permission to distribute them via the conference’s itch.io page. These works can be at any development stage, from prototypes to finished products. The projects will not be physically exhibited at the conference. Instead, we ask authors to submit, along with their creative work, a 1000-1500 word abstract—excluding references—in Word or PDF format for peer review. The review of interactive works will be made following criteria based on their creative and expressive value, with academic value being relevant but secondary to the conditions of acceptance. We encourage the submission of works that explore agency and possible worlds using the rhetorics and poetics of playable media.

Authors of all accepted submissions should prepare a 30-minute talk to be recorded and archived as part of the conference proceedings. Remote participation is possible for accepted works by authors whose economic or geographical situation does not allow travel. 

Playing Futures does not focus on research that treats games as purely utilitarian tools in formal education settings, nor on “gamification” approaches to addressing climate and energy issues. Instead, Playing Futures wants to explore what games and play, as forms of entertainment and aesthetic experience, can contribute during and after climate and energy crises. 

Playing Futures is particularly interested in perspectives from geographical and disciplinary margins that explore how futures are represented, simulated, and played in both digital and analog games, along with examining the role of game production in shaping futures. The Playing Futures conference encourages participants to present work that considers the future from a generational viewpoint, beyond the urgency of the present. 

Playing Futures is a single-track, presentation-based conference where authors will have 30 minutes to present their work, with at least 15 minutes available for discussion. The conference will take place at the IT University of Copenhagen between May xxx and May yyy. The talks will not be streamed, but the conference proceedings will consist of recordings of the presentations. The conference is free to attend.
